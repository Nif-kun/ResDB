# ResDB
Compiles all Resource objects in one display by setting up a directory for it to check:
1. Press the plus (+) icon at the top left to add a directory you want to scan.
2. Provide the name and path before confirming.
3. Once added, the directory will now appear on the left side for easy future access.
4. If the directory is populated with Resource files, it will appear in the selection grid.
5. You may now click the Resource file and modify it in the editor inspection dock.
6. In the case of deleting the directory, simply click the directory and hover on it to show the delete button.
